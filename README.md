# nooblinkninjas-nft-based-ticketing-system-blockmagic

### Description
NoobLink Ninjas was my hackathon team for the Chainlink BlockMagic hackathon in 2024.
The hackathon submission was a NFT-based sports event ticketing system.

* These is the latest version of the submission when I finished the hackathon.
* There is also a directory that acts as a sandbox to store and test code I was working on prior to bring it into the project.

### Current Goals
Test if the app is functional in current state, and assess from here. 
Review and reach out to teammates about any commits in ahead of original fork.
